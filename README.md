An analysis of the worst drivers by state
Final Project Checklist
To receive full credit, you’ll need to deliver on all of the items in the checklist below. Please read carefully through this checklist before you make your project proposal. You are (within these checklist constraints) strongly urged to limit scope and make the necessary simplifying assumptions so that you can deliver your work on time!
 Proposal describes your motivation for performing this analysis.
 Proposal describes from where you plan to source your data.
 Your project has a recognizable and reproducible “data analytics workflow.” [Example: First the data is acquired, then
necessary transformations and clean-up are performed, then the analysis and presentation work is performed]
 Project includes data from at least two different types of data sources (e.g., two or more of these: (1) relational, (2)
scraped web page, (3) web API.
 Project includes at least one data transformation operation. [Examples: transforming from wide to long; converting
columns to date format]
 Project includes at least one grouping or aggregation.
 Project includes at least one statistical analysis and at least one graphics that describes or validates your data.
 Project includes at least one graphic that supports your conclusion(s).
 Project includes at least one statistical analysis that supports your conclusion(s).
 Project includes at least one feature that we did not cover in class! There are many examples: “I used Bokeh; I created a
decision tree; I ranked the results; I created my presentation slides directly from my Jupyter Notebook; I figured out to
use OAuth 2.0...”
 Presentation. Was the presentation delivered in the allotted time (3 to 5 minutes)?
 Presentation. Did you show (at least) one challenge you encountered in code and/or data, and what you did when you
encountered that challenge? If you didn’t encounter any challenges, your assignment was clearly too easy for you!
 Presentation. Did the audience come away with a clear understanding of your motivation for undertaking the project?
 Presentation. Did the audience come away with a clear understanding of at least one insight you gained or conclusion
you reached or hypothesis you “confirmed” (rejected or failed to reject...)?
 Code and data. Have you delivered the submitted code and data where it is reproducible and self-contained—preferably
in a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub? Am I able to fully reproduce your results with what you’ve delivered? You won’t
receive full credit if your code references data on your local machine!
 Code and data. Does all of the delivered code run without errors?
 Deadline management.Submit yuor work on time!
